**The picture above is the simulation operation of the Bollinger strategy, where the blue part represents shorting and the red represents longing, and the width of the area represents the position holding time. In the chronological order, the left represents opening position, and the right represents closing position. The perPrf represents the income of the region, positive numbers indicate profit, negative numbers indicate loss**.

**KuCoin** provides **the transaction data of level 3, great matching engine, and the commission discount specially offers to the API customers**. At the same time, we offer the **sandbox environment** as the data testing support to avoid the risks.

Only a simple and incomplete trading strategy is provided here, so please pay attention to **avoiding risks** when using it. We hope that you can **make test adjustments in the sandbox environment with other parameters or strategies,  as we do not want you to become a philanthropist! ! !**

Surely, if you encounter any problems in this process, or you have a profitable strategy to share, please reflect in **ISSUE**, we will try to respond in a timely manner.
